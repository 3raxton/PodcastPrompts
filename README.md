# Podcast Prompts

## What is this for?
When I wanted to start a podcast I had no idea what to talk about. I found that prompts helped me immensley and I thought I would bring some to people looking for ideas on what to talk about podcasting, I thought I would bring a few of my own to the plate and share with you!

## If you want to add a prompt:

All contributions are welcome!
